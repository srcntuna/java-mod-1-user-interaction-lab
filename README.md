# User Interaction Lab

## Learning Goals

- Take user input
- Process and display user input

## Instructions

Ask the user to enter their age and display a greeting to them based on whether
they are younger or older than 18. Take care to handle the case where they are
exactly 18.

Display an extra special message to them if they are younger than 10.
